# makeweb: A static website generator

Makeweb is a simple [Makefile-based][openbsd-man-make] static website generator
designed to work on a modern UNIX system. The generator parses
[Markdown][fireball-markdown] files into [HTML5][mdn-html5] documents, which can
be hosted with any web server. Major features of makeweb include:

* Incremental build system with configurable triggers;
* Markdown-based source files;
* Publish to remote or local directories;
* Makefile-based configuration;
* Perl-based template and seperate CSS stylesheet.

This utility was originally based on John Hawthorn's 
[This Website is a Makefile][hawthorn-make] article.

## Prerequisites 

A modern UNIX system should have all of the required software pre-installated. 
However, ensure the following software is installed before proceeding:

* [Perl][perl] (>=5.10.0);
* [openrsync(1)][openbsd-man-openrsync] or [rsync][samba-rsync] (>=2.6.0);
* [make(1)][openbsd-man-make].

Note that a web server, such as [httpd(8)][openbsd-man-httpd], is needed to 
serve the HTML documents that are generated. Configuring a web server is not 
covered in this documentation.

This software was developed and tested using [OpenBSD 6.7][openbsd-67].

## Usage
For every file with the `.md` extension in the `src/` tree, an `index.html` HTML 
document is generated in the `htdocs/` tree. This document will be located in a
folder with the same name as the Markdown file. For example, `src/foo/bar.md`
will produce `htdocs/foo/bar/index.html`. One exception to this rule is
`src/index.md`, which generates `htdocs/index.html`. 

Any non-`.md` file in the `src/` tree will be copied to the `htdocs/` tree
during the normal build process. 

HTML documents are generated and published by using [make(1)][openbsd-man-make].
The following targets are available for use:

* `all` *(default)*

	Generates all HTML documents and copies all assets in the `src/` directory
	tree to the `htdocs/` directory. This is the default target.

* `clean`

	Empties the `htdocs/` directory.

* `htdocs`

	Copies all non-Markdown files in the `src/` directory tree to the `htdocs/`
	directory.

* `html`

	Generates HTML documents from Markdown files in the `src/` tree. All documents
	will be stored in the `htdocs/` as described above. During the build process, 
	`style.css` will be copied to `htdocs/style.css`.

* `preview`

	Publishes `htdocs/` to the preview directory specified in the `Makefile.site` 
	configuration file. *If no directory is specified, an error will occur.*

* `publish`

	Publishes `htdocs/` to the web root directory specified in the `Makefile.site`
	configuration file. *If no directory is specified, an error will occur.*

Additional targets exist, which are triggered before each target listed above. 
These can be customized in the `Makefile.site` configuration file and are
described in more detail below.

Makeweb comes with a standard `template.pl` and `style.css`,  which can be 
modified as required. The `publish` and `preview` targets will trigger errors 
unless they are defined and non-empty in the `Makefile.site` configuration file.

## Configuration
Makeweb can be configured by editing the `Makefile.site` configuration file. 
This file is able to set or override any variable used by the `Makefile`
recipe. The default `Makefile.site` configuration file contains configuration 
examples and documents all variables which can be overridden. The `PREVIEW-DIR` 
and `PUBLISH-DIR` variables must be set, otherwise the `preview` and `publish` 
targets will cause an error to occur.

Each target listed above has an additional target, which is trigged before 
execution of the original target. Custom recipes for these targets can be
created in `Makefile.site` in order to customize the build process. If a
custom target fails, then the primary target will not execute. The following
custom targets are available: `on-all`, `on-assets`, `on-build`, `on-clean`,
`on-preview`, `on-publish`.

The `preview` and publish `targets` use rsync and so both local and remote 
directories can be used. Remote directories may require user interactive for 
password input. 


## Template
The file `template.pl` is a Perl script which generates an HTML5 document from
a Markdown file, passed as a command line argument to the script. The default
template includes basic `breadcrumb` and `datestamp` functions. Modifying this
file will cause all pages to be re-generated on the next build.

Note that this script uses the [Text::Markdown][cpan-markdown] Perl module to 
convert Markdown syntax into HTML. This module is included in the `perl5lib/`
directory.

## Stylesheet
The default template generates HTML documents which will link to the
`src/style.css` [CSS][mdn-css] file. Modifying this file will affect the 
presentation of each generated HTML document, however re-building all HTML 
documents is not necessary.

## Bugs

details (operating system, software versions, etc) as possible when reporting 
bugs.
